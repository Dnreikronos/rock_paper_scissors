          <p>
            The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a
            rock, paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a
            flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing
            downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers
            fully extended toward the opposing player. Rock wins against
            scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.
            If both players throw the same hand signal, it is considered a tie,
            and play resumes until there is a clear winner
