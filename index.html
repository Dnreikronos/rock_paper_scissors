          The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a
          rock, paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat
          hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and
          scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended
          toward the opposing player. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins
          against rock; and scissors wins against paper. If both players throw
          the same hand signal, it is considered a tie, and play resumes until
          there is a clear winner
