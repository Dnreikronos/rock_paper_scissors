      The game is played with three possible hand signals that represent a rock,
      paper, and scissors. The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with
      fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a
      fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing
      player. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors
      wins against paper. If both players throw the same hand signal, it is
      considered a tie, and play resumes until there is a clear winner
